# Shooting

Even though the shooting face happens after movement ships rarely remain stationary for shooting. The actual shooting counts as being done anytime during the move, that is to say use the best point along the ships movement path to calculate *line of sight*.  
  
The indiviudal steps of the shooting phase can be broken down like this:
 * Choosing a ship to shoot
 * Designating a target
 * Measure distance
 * Calculated *to-hit* value
 * Roll to hit
 * Roll to damage
 * Resolve damage

## Choosing a ship to shoot
Valid selections are all ships that have not previously fired is weapons during this player turn. Or does not intend to perform any repairs.

## Designating a target
Valid targets are any enemy ship within the maxiumum firing range. The firing ship also need to have *Line of sight* to the target.

## Calculate *to-hit* value
Start with the value from the target value for the specific range written on the profile card. Then add the following modifiers to calculate the "to-hit" value:
 
 * Add 2 if firing against the targets bow or stern
 * Add 2 if the target is at least 25% obstructed

## Roll to hit
Roll a D20 for every shell fired, any roll above or equal to the *to-hit* value.
