# Movement

Big warships are heavy and have a significant amount of momentum! This means they are not able to neither turn or change speeds directly. The rules in this section helps illustrate that.

## Acceleration table

This is an example of what an acceleration table might look like. The one the player should use is represented on the *profile card*.

The top row is the number of rounds the ship has accelerated and bottom row indicates the available move distance. 

| 1 |   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| -3| 0 | 3 | 6 | 9 |

The core rule is this: *For a ship to accelerate to the next higher speed it must have moved the maximum allowed distance the previous round*  
And by extension: *For a ship to slow down to the previous speed it must have moved the minimum distance the previous round*

**Example 1:** A ship is stationary and (counts as having moved 0 cm the last round) and wishes to move forward. It can now choose to move any distance between 0 and 3 cm, however if it wishes to move further the next round it has to move a full 3 cm.

**Example 2:** A ship moved 6 its last round. It can now choose to either move in its new accelarated range (that is 6 to 9 cm) or to slow down and move in the same range as last round (3 to 6 cm). If it chooses to do the later it will be degraded to the lower speed range the next round and will have accelarate back up again to travel faster.

**Example 3:** A ship moved 6 its last round. It now chooses to move 3 cm in order to be able to come to a complete stop the next round.

**Example 4:** A ship was stationary the last round. It can now choose to go into reverse and travel up to -3 cm.

## Turning

A ship need to have significant speed in order for the rudder to become effective and actually turn vessel. How much speed required differs between different kinds of ship and is written on *profile card* under *Turn-speed*.

*A ship can turn up to 45 degrees for each 'Turn-speed' cm it travels*

**Example: ** A ship cabable of moving 12 cm this round and having a *Turn-speed* of 4, can turn up to 3 times. One turn each time it travels 4 cm.
