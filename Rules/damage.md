# Damage

General goes here. 

## Damage boxes

## Hits penetrating armor plating

Any time a damage point is allocated past the hull plating zone this means that the round has penetrated the armor and is wreaking havoc on the inside.

Immediatly take a morale check.

## Hull damage

Damage to the hull can be catastrophic. If the damage boxes for hull damage ever runs out the hull will suffer a structure collapse and the ship will sink!

## Gun damage

0 boxes = Gun crew dead / loading mechanisms detroyed. May not fire for rest of game.

## Engine damage

No more damage boxes = Engines destroyed and can not be repaired.
